# Hang-Man-Game
The classic hang man game written in python using pygame!

The game goes like this: a random word is chosen (along with a randomly selected letter from that word) to be the shown to the player. The player uses logical thinking to determin the missing letters. If the user can not complete the selected word before he/she runs out of tries, the player loses. To win the game the player must fully complete the word.
